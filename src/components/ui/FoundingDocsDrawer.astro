          </p>

          <h4>Section 2 — The House of Representatives</h4>
          <p>
            The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by
            the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the
            Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State
            Legislature.
          </p>
          <p>
            No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty
            five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when
            elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.
          </p>
          <div class="full-only">
            <p>
              Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which
              may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall
              be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to
              Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all
              other Persons.
            </p>
            <p>
              The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the
              Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such
              Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one
              for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative.
            </p>
            <p>
              When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority
              thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.
            </p>
            <p>

          </p>
          <div class="full-only">
            <p>
              Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they
              shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of
              the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second
              Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration
              of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year.
            </p>
            <p>
              No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years,

              be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.

              the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that
              Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States
              is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without
              the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
            </p>
            <p>
              Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office,
              and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the
              United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to
              Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

              after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as
              if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in
