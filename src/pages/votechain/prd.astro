        <p class="font-bold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-3">The library card version:</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">What is this?</p>
        <p class="mb-3">This is a really long plan — like the blueprints for a building, but for a computer system that checks whether people are allowed to vote. It's not a real thing yet. It's a plan that says "here's how we <em>could</em> build it" so people can argue about it, poke holes in it, and make it better.</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Why was it written?</p>
        <p class="mb-3">For a really long time, grown-ups have been saying "voting is broken!" but nobody ever drew up a plan to fix any part of it. This is someone finally saying "okay, here's a plan — tell me what's wrong with it."</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">How it works:</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Imagine voting is like borrowing a library book.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li><strong>You make your library card one time.</strong> You prove who you are once — then after that, you just show your card. No need to bring your birth certificate every time you want a book.</li>
          <li><strong>A big shared notebook keeps track.</strong> 74 different librarians all have a copy of the same notebook, and they all have to agree before anything gets written down. No single librarian can cheat.</li>
          <li><strong>The notebook doesn't say which stories you like.</strong> It only knows <em>that</em> a book was checked out — not which one. Your reading habits are your business.</li>
          <li><strong>If somebody tries to check out two books at once, it gets caught right away.</strong> The notebook sees the duplicate instantly — not weeks later.</li>
          <li><strong>If something looks weird, you still get a temporary pass</strong> while the adults figure it out. You never get turned away with nothing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-3">VoteChain tries to do exactly this for voting: prove who you are <strong>once</strong>, catch cheating <strong>fast</strong>, and never take away your right to vote while things get sorted out.</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">"But doesn't it know all my stuff?"</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Nope. The library already has your name and address on file — that's how you got your card. But the <strong>notebook</strong> only says "someone checked out a book." Not your name. Not which book. VoteChain is the notebook, not the library's filing cabinet. Your personal info stays where it already is.</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Some quick numbers:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1.5 mb-4">
          <li>Costs about <strong>$5.60 per vote</strong> to run — we already spend $4-6 billion each election cycle</li>
          <li>Would take about <strong>5 years</strong> to build and roll out to all 50 states</li>
          <li>Under <strong>60 seconds</strong> at the polls — faster than the current ID check</li>
          <li><strong>Free</strong> for voters — enrollment, secure cards, everything</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-3">Here's what 1,525 lines boil down to:</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">What is this?</p>
        <p class="mb-3">A complete technical blueprint — a detailed plan for building a system that verifies voters are who they say they are. It's not a law. It's not software you can download. It's a proposal that anyone can read, tear apart, and improve.</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Why does it exist?</p>
        <p class="mb-3">For 20 years, people across the political spectrum have said "elections are broken" — but nobody has published a concrete, buildable plan to fix any part of it. This tackles one specific piece: verifying that every person who votes is a citizen, is eligible, is alive, and hasn't already voted.</p>

        <p class="mb-3"><strong>VoteChain is a voter <em>verification</em> system — not a voting machine.</strong> It doesn't touch your ballot. It answers four questions with mathematical proof: Are you a citizen? Are you eligible? Are you alive? Have you already voted?</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">"But what about my personal data?"</p>
        <p class="mb-3">VoteChain lives <strong>entirely on the verification side</strong>. It receives a cryptographic "yes, this person checks out" — and that's all it stores. No names. No Social Security numbers. No addresses. No biometrics. Just math that proves someone was verified, without revealing who they are.</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">How it works:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li>Enroll <strong>once</strong> through multi-source identity checks. This generates a <strong>digital credential</strong> — a secure digital key proving you're a verified voter.</li>
          <li>At the polls, the system uses a <strong>zero-knowledge proof</strong> — confirming "yes, this person is eligible" <em>without revealing who they are</em>.</li>
          <li>Every verification event is recorded on an <strong>immutable ledger</strong> — 74 separate computers all have to agree before anything gets written.</li>
          <li>Finalizing any record requires <strong>3 of 4 independent operator groups</strong> to agree — federal, state, auditor, and oversight nodes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">How it catches fraud:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Instantly at the polls:</strong> Duplicate vote attempts caught in seconds via one-time-use nullifiers.</li>
          <li><strong>In the background:</strong> Death records, court records, and suspicious patterns checked continuously. Target: flagging within 48 hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">The numbers:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Cost:</strong> ~$870M to build + ~$375M/year to run (~$5.60 per vote)</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 5-year phased rollout</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Under 60 seconds at the polls</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Who audits?</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Quarterly independent audits. <strong>25 randomly selected citizens</strong> (jury-duty model) choose which firm does the audit. Results are published publicly. The entire system is open source.</p>

        <p class="text-navy-500 text-sm italic mt-4">Close this and read the full blueprint with architecture diagrams, data schemas, and threat models.</p>

      <Fragment slot="technical">
        <p class="font-bold text-lg text-navy-900 mb-3">Technical summary:</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Scope:</p>
        <p class="mb-3">A 1,525-line PRD specifying a permissioned blockchain-based voter verification layer. Verification-only — sits alongside existing election infrastructure. Buildable blueprint: architecture, data schemas, threat models, cost models, rollout phases, and 14 open questions.</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">PII boundary:</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Strict separation between <strong>identity enrollment plane</strong> (SSA, USCIS, state vital records) and <strong>verification plane</strong> (VoteChain). The chain never ingests PII. DID-to-PII linkage only in state-operated encrypted vaults, accessible by court order. Architectural invariant, not a policy promise.</p>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Architecture:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Consortium chain</strong> (Hyperledger Fabric-class): 74-node BFT — 6 federal, 50 state, 12 auditor, 6 oversight. Category-quorum: 3-of-4 categories, &ge;2/3 intra-category.</li>
          <li><strong>Identity:</strong> W3C DIDs with voter-held private keys. zk-SNARKs prove all five attestation pillars without disclosing identity.</li>
          <li><strong>Data model:</strong> Per-state channels + one national channel for nullifier dedup. Target: 10,000+ TPS, &lt;3s finality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Five verification pillars:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Citizenship:</strong> 2-of-4 source attestation at enrollment, DID-bound, 10-year expiry.</li>
          <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Per-election smart contract — age, residency, judicial status, registration.</li>
          <li><strong>Liveness:</strong> Biometric (local match, never centralized) or non-biometric first-class path. &lt;48h death-record revocation SLA.</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate Prevention:</strong> One-time nullifier = hash(DID + election_id). Cross-state real-time detection.</li>
          <li><strong>Chain-of-Custody:</strong> Device DIDs with HSM attestation co-sign events.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Fraud detection:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Synchronous:</strong> Nullifier collision, invalid ZKP, compromised device, geographic impossibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Asynchronous:</strong> Death matching, judicial drift, enrollment anomaly clustering, rate-limit violations.</li>
          <li><strong>Flag lifecycle:</strong> Detected &rarr; Triaged &rarr; Investigated &rarr; Resolved (immutable on-chain).</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Cost &amp; rollout:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
          <li>Baseline: ~$870M capex, ~$375M/yr opex. High-risk: $3.0-4.0B / $0.7-0.9B/yr.</li>
          <li>Phases: Governance (M1-12), POC (M1-6), hardening (M6-24), pilots (M24-36), federal (M36-60).</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Open questions (14):</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Blockchain framework, ZKP system (Groth16 vs PLONK vs STARKs), 50-state eligibility codification, same-day registration, smart contract governance, ZKP offload for low-end devices, UOCAVA deadlines, tribal nation interop, post-quantum migration, oversight board independence.</p>
